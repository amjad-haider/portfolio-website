# My Portfolio Repo

![Angular Version](https://img.shields.io/badge/Angular-v18%2B-red?style=flat-square&logo=angular)

## 1. About the Project

The aim of this repo is to create structured components for my portfolio website so i can update the contents efficiently using modern frameworks like Angular. I chose this approach over vibe coding as i know where each component is if any error occurs. I would like to create a design that is unique to myself.

## 2. Technology Stack Used

This portfolio is built using the **Angular** framework:

Category | Technology | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Framework** | Angular | Core application structure and component management. |
| **UI/Styling** | Angular Material | Implements Google's Material Design for a clean, professional aesthetic. |
| **Language** | TypeScript | Ensures strong typing and robust front-end development. |
| **Deployment** | GitHub Pages | Hosting via the dedicated `amjad-haider.github.io` repository. |
| **Package Manager** | npm / Angular CLI | Project management, dependency handling, and build process. |
